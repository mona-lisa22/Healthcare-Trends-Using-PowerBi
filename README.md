# Healthcare Waitlist Analysis Using PowerBi

 This Hospital Waitlist Dashboard in Power BI helps track patient waiting times and trends.
 
# Analysis and Visualization

✔ How does the current year’s total waitlist compare to the previous year?
  
  - To calculate the data between prevous and current year's waiting list , I have implemented a measure to show it in KPI's

✔ How many Patient falls under which Case Type?
